# Programming-language
a programming language i made with python. you can only write 10 lines of code because i cant be bothered to add like a 100 more if statements
the programming language is just numbers, there is an output and math, there is 10 lines of code max, + add 1 to the current output, - subtracts 1 from the current output, * multiplies the current output by 2, and / divides the current output by 2
